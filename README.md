# ScannerPhase1
This project consists of developing an interpreter in 3 parts: lexical analyzer (scanner), syntax analyzer (parser) and interpreter.  The interpreter is for a minimal form of the Julia language (see JuliaLang.org). This minimal form of Julia has only 1 data type, integer, and the only identifiers are single letters. Additional information about the Julia language is below.
